## Layered architecture
`Clean Architecture`
It achieves this by separating the application into different layers that have distinct responsibilities:

<img width="253" alt="clean-architecture-layers" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d22c667b-6f18-4728-a6f0-b6c514e16e06">

### 1. Domain Layer
Contains the core business logic and domain entities. This layer is independent of other layers and focuses on the business rules and domain models.
#### Components:
- Entities: Represent the core data models. For example, User, Role, Hotel, Room, Booking.
- Value Objects: Define immutable objects used within the domain. For example, Address, Money.
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Define the data structures used for communication between the application layer and the API layer. For example, UserDto, BookingDto.
- Domain Repository: Implement business logic that does not naturally fit within an entity. For example, DiscountRepository.
### 2. Infrastructure Layer
Provides implementations for data access, external services, and other system-level concerns. This layer interacts with databases, file systems, and external APIs.
#### Components:
- Repositories: Implement data access logic and interact with the database. For example, UserRepository, HotelRepository.
- Data Context: Manages database connections and operations. For example, AppDbContext.
- Configurations: Manage configurations for external services and data access.
### 3. Application Layer
Orchestrates the application's workflow, coordinates interactions between domain models and infrastructure, and handles application-specific logic.
#### Components:
- Services: Implement application-specific logic and use domain services and repositories to perform operations. For example, UserService, BookingService.
- Application Interfaces: Define contracts for services and repositories. For example, IUserService, IBookingService.
 - External Services: Handle interactions with third-party services. For example, image storage services, payment gateways.
### 4. API Layer
Exposes endpoints for client interaction and handles HTTP requests and responses. This layer is responsible for routing, validation, and transforming data between the application layer and clients.
#### Components:
- Controllers: Handle incoming HTTP requests, invoke application services, and return responses. For example, UserController, BookingController.
- Middlewares: Implement cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, authorization, and logging.
- Response Handlers: Standardize API responses and error handling. For example, ResponseHandler.

## Image Storage
### Cloudinary Integration
Cloudinary is used for managing and storing images in the Hotel Booking Platform. It provides a scalable, secure, and feature-rich solution for image storage and transformation.

<img width="503" alt="cloud" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c91f3e2-1023-442a-b250-a458db4b0d32">

#### We add account informations on appsettings.json and create an entity whose name is CloudinarySettings.
<img width="246" alt="setting" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb570e84-265c-49ea-8115-721a9784087d">

### 1. Image Upload
- Endpoint: `POST /api/image/upload`

### 2. Image Retrieval
- Endpoint:` GET /api/image/details/{publicId}`

### 3. Image Deletion
- Endpoint: `DELETE /api/image/delete-image/{publicId}`
## üì©  Booking Confirmation 
Once a booking is confirmed, users receive an email containing the details of their reservation. Below is an example of the booking confirmation email that users receive:

## üîãü™´ Testing Frameworks 
Ensuring code quality and functionality with comprehensive testing suites using:

- ##### xUnit: A popular .NET testing framework that facilitates writing and executing unit tests with a focus on simplicity and extensibility. ‚úÖ
- ##### Moq: A powerful mocking library for .NET that allows creating mock objects for unit testing, enabling isolated and controlled test scenarios. üß™
- ##### FluentAssertions: A library that provides a more expressive and readable syntax for assertions, making tests easier to write and understand. üìè
- ##### Fixture: A testing concept used to set up shared contexts for multiple test cases, allowing for efficient and consistent test execution. üß©

## Design Patterns
In the Hotel Booking Platform, several design patterns are employed to ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture. Here‚Äôs a summary of the key patterns used:
### 1. Unit of Work Pattern
The Unit of Work pattern is used to manage changes to multiple entities in a single transaction. This pattern ensures that changes to the database are handled in a single unit, maintaining data consistency and integrity.

<img width="457" alt="Unitofwork" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4007b80-a962-4fca-952e-d2bee8655f3c">

### 2. Generic Repository Pattern
The Generic Repository pattern provides a way to manage CRUD operations in a consistent and reusable manner. This pattern abstracts the data access layer and provides a generic implementation for common operations.

## üï∞Ô∏è Project Management 
#### Use of Trello for Task Management
